## A List CoreML-Models projects and resources. Feel free to contribute!

#  With Core ML, you can integrate trained machine learning models into your app.

CoreML-Models is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a set of training data. The model makes predictions based on new input data. For example, a model that's been trained on a region's historical house prices may be able to predict a house's price when given the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
